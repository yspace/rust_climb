/*
Traits can be marked unsafe to indicate that impling the trait might require unsafe code.
 Both Send and Sync are marked unsafe because if they aren't automatically implemented for a type that means it must contains some non-Send or non-Sync member and we have to take extra care as the implementers to make sure there are no data races if we want to manually mark the type as Send and Sync.

// SomeType is not Send or Sync
struct SomeType {
    not_send_or_sync: *const (),

// but if we're confident that our impl doesn't have any data
// races we can explicitly mark it as Send and Sync using unsafe
