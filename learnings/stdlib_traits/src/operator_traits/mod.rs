All operators in Rust are associated with traits. If we'd like to impl operators for our types we have to impl the associated traits.
Trait(s) 	Category 	Operator(s) 	Description
Eq, PartialEq 	comparison 	== 	equality
Ord, PartialOrd 	comparison 	<, >, <=, >= 	comparison
Add 	arithmetic 	+ 	addition
AddAssign 	arithmetic 	+= 	addition assignment
BitAnd 	arithmetic 	& 	bitwise AND
BitAndAssign 	arithmetic 	&= 	bitwise assignment
BitXor 	arithmetic 	^ 	bitwise XOR
BitXorAssign 	arithmetic 	^= 	bitwise XOR assignment
Div 	arithmetic 	/ 	division
DivAssign 	arithmetic 	/= 	division assignment
Mul 	arithmetic 	* 	multiplication
MulAssign 	arithmetic 	*= 	multiplication assignment
Neg 	arithmetic 	- 	unary negation
Not 	arithmetic 	! 	unary logical negation
Rem 	arithmetic 	% 	remainder
RemAssign 	arithmetic 	%= 	remainder assignment
Shl 	arithmetic 	<< 	left shift
ShlAssign 	arithmetic 	<<= 	left shift assignment
Shr 	arithmetic 	>> 	right shift
ShrAssign 	arithmetic 	>>= 	right shift assignment
Sub 	arithmetic 	- 	subtraction
SubAssign 	arithmetic 	-= 	subtraction assignment
Fn 	closure 	(...args) 	immutable closure invocation
FnMut 	closure 	(...args) 	mutable closure invocation
FnOnce 	closure 	(...args) 	one-time closure invocation
Deref 	other 	* 	immutable dereference
DerefMut 	other 	* 	mutable dereference
Drop 	other 	- 	type destructor
Index 	other 	[] 	immutable index
IndexMut 	other 	[] 	mutable index
RangeBounds 	other 	.. 	range
