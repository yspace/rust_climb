trait ToOwned {
    type Owned: Borrow<Self>;

ToOwned is a more generic version of Clone. Clone allows us to take a &T and turn it into an T but ToOwned allows us to take a &Borrowed and turn it into a Owned where Owned: Borrow<Borrowed>.

    In other words, we can't "clone" a &str into a String, or a &Path into a PathBuf, or an &OsStr into an OsString, since the clone method signature doesn't support this kind of cross-type cloning, and that's what ToOwned was made for.

For similar reasons as Borrow and BorrowMut, it's good to be aware of this trait and understand why it exists but it's very rare we'll ever need to impl it for any of our types.
