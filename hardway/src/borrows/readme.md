use Rust's smart pointers for interconnected data structures.

[Item 9](https://www.lurklurk.org/effective-rust/references.html) described the most common smart pointer types provided by Rust's standard library.

    Rc allows shared ownership, with multiple things referring to the same item. Often combined withâ€¦
    RefCell allows interior mutability, so that internal state can be modified without needing a mutable reference. This comes at the cost of moving borrow checks from compile-time to run-time.
    Arc is the multi-threading equivalent to Rc.
    Mutex (and RwLock) allows interior mutability in a multi-threading environment, roughly equivalent to RefCell.
    Cell allows interior mutability for Copy types.
