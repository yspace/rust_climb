[application state](www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/state.html)
W3C defines application state :
as how an application is: its configuration, attributes, condition or information content. State changes happen in an application component when triggered by an event. More specifically, in the context of applications that provide a RESTful web API to manage resources over a URI , application state is closely related to the state of the resources that are part of the application.
